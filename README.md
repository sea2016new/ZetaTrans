# ZetaTrans
This script is an automated transaction tool written in Node.js using the Ethers.js library, designed to perform automated transfers on Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. It reads a list of Ethereum addresses from a text file and sends a random amount of Ether (or compatible tokens) to each address.
